so for now the topic is about creating class by yourself and use them when ou are doing the program like self defined class. 

so at first now it is giving me the memory space and nothing other so I am going to check the other things how to use th question model class I think we got the other class only just for the model and then we will have the data file then we have the main py which the file we are going to run so what is excatly needed to do is to model the question first , then the take the dataand make it a s aomdeledand print it but Idk why it is giving the memory location only

so one thing is at the point now it is okay to get those objects as a result but one more thing is the instructor include a list first taking the objects in the list
