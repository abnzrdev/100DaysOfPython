so for now the thing is more concentrated on reading documentation using the turtle module as example and as the turtle module is based on tkinter for its gui it uses some color names from it and to find the color names the good website is https://cs111.wellesley.edu/reference/colors. and practice for this lesson to check on the turtle module read the documentation a bit and make the turtle to go a little bit and mess around for some minutes
the turtle challenge is to draw a square done
and one more thing that is side note is like we can change the variable name in pycharm at once selec them refactor and rename.
so when the library has a long name we can use like
import turtle as m or some thing which will make it like importing the library or the module and giving it some kind of letter for it.

alright the other thing is about using venv so what I understand is like the packages that we are going to install in the pycharm are going to be taken care of pycharm to check that if they really works with our code and there si also some kin dof historical problesm that I really didn't get but wheen it is application it will be installe to all but when it is packeage then it will be installed for that project only.

alright the next thing is to draw a dashed line this is practice

alright the next thing is to draw the triangle , square , pen, hex hept octa, nona, deca on the same surface.

draw random walk  this will get bigger. so on the random walk what is the new thing is like we are gonna have the different thickness so what i want is how to change the thickness and the next thing is importing random and the color names and that is all
