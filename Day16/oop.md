# 📝 OOP Notes - Coffee Machine Project - Abenezer

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### 🏗️ Classes & Objects
• **Class** = Blueprint/template (like a house plan)
• **Object** = Actual thing made from blueprint (like actual house) 🏠
• In my code: `Menu()`, `CoffeeMaker()`, `MoneyMachine()` are objects created from their classes

### ⚙️ Methods vs Functions
• **Function** = Independent worker (like `maintenance()` in my code) 🔧
• **Method** = Function that belongs to a class (like `coffee.make_coffee()`)
• Methods work with object's data, functions work alone

### 🔒 Encapsulation
• **Encapsulation** = Keeping object's data safe inside
• Like my `money` object - only it can change its own money amount
• Other parts of code can't directly mess with internal data

### 🧠 Object State
• **State** = What an object remembers about itself
• Like my `coffee` object remembering:
- 💧 Water: 300ml → 250ml → 200ml
- 🥛 Milk: 200ml → 150ml → 100ml
  • State changes when I make drinks!

### 👨‍👦 Inheritance
• **Inheritance** = Child class gets everything from parent
• Syntax: `class EspressoMachine(CoffeeMaker):`
• Espresso machine would inherit water/coffee handling but remove milk part since espresso doesn't need milk! ☕

### 🎭 Polymorphism
• **Polymorphism** = Same method name, different behavior
• Even if `EspressoMachine`, `CappuccinoMachine`, `LatteMachine` all have `make_coffee()`, each behaves uniquely
• They show their unique behavior even with same parent!

## 🎉 OOP Concepts Mastered:

✅ **Classes & Objects** - Blueprint vs Real thing  
✅ **Methods & Functions** - Belongs to class vs Independent  
✅ **Encapsulation** - Keep data safe inside objects  
✅ **Object State** - What objects remember  
✅ **Inheritance** - Child gets parent's abilities  
✅ **Polymorphism** - Same name, different behavior

## 💡 Key Understanding:
OOP is like building with LEGO blocks - each object is a specialized block that knows how to work with itself and others! 🧱
